# LAB - 02

## Gallery Of Horns

I build an app that allows the user to view different Horned Beast.

- Once the user clicks on an image, it will pop up a bigger image of the image chosen.
- At the same time:
  - You will favorite the image
  - Increase a like on the image
  - Decrease your wallet by number of Horns the image has

### Reflections and Comments

- From today, I learned that sometimes, even on a fresh day, its best to read over the errors and spend more time looking to make sure all the words are correct, as a misspelled word can sometimes not provide an error.
- This project was tough, there were many new aspects that we learned and a lot of new things we were not used to. We even had an issue with the version of BootStrap which did not make our CardColumns work, to fix this, we had to decrease the version number back to the correct one that we knew that works
- After completing this App, I learned a lot more about React, switch your brain over from React and JavaScript is no easy task, but its interesting to be able to work through that.

## Lab 02

### Number and name of feature: Feature #1: Display images

Estimate of time needed to complete: Most of this was easy and I was able to follow along, using the forEach through the array was the most difficult, I had an error in spelling that I did not catch and i put it in a function which was just adding more problems.

Estimate of time needed to complete: 3 hours

Start time: 1:43pm

Finish time: 5:30pc

Actual time needed to complete: 5 hours

Summary: This lab was very difficult, and showed that understanding the props and states with the child and parents are very valuable, but very difficult.

## Lab 04

### Number and name of feature: Feature 1. Filter by Numbers of Horns

Estimate of time needed to complete: 3 hours

Start time: 7/20/2021 8:30pm

Finish time: 7/20/2021 8pm

Actual time needed to complete: Around 4 hours

Summary: I had a good idea of what to do, I tried to filtered out the array, once I got stuck I asked for some help from a TA, and he showed me that I did not need to make another function, but to filter through the array that we already have using a conditional to take back the certain number of horns the image has.
