## Gallery Of Horns

I build an app that allows the user to view different Horned Beast. They also can be interactive with the app and choose which Horned Beast they like as well as favorite the ones they like the most.

with a direct and powerful purpose. It does all of the things that it accomplishes well. I should describe the purpose and functionality so those that visit my README understand the app

### Reflections and Comments

- From today, I learned that sometimes, even on a fresh day, its best to read over the errors and spend more time looking to make sure all the words are correct, as a misspelled word can sometimes not provide an error.
- This project was tough, there were many new aspects that we learned and a lot of new things we were not used to. We even had an issue with the version of BootStrap which did not make our CardColumns work, to fix this, we had to decrease the version number back to the correct one that we knew that works

### Number and name of feature: Feature #1: Display images

Estimate of time needed to complete: Most of this was easy and I was able to follow along, using the forEach through the array was the most difficult, I had an error in spelling that I did not catch and i put it in a function which was just adding more problems.
